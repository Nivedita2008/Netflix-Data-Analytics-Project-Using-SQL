## Project Overview
This project performs end-to-end data analysis on the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset using PostgreSQL.
A structured relational table was created, followed by 15 real-world business queries that uncover insights about content trends, actors, genres, ratings, countries, and more.

The project demonstrates strong SQL skills, including:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Date parsing with to_date()

Text processing using string_to_array(), unnest(), split_part()

Window functions (rank(), over())

Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

Aggregation and grouping

Pattern matching using ILIKE
